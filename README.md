Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering priniples, methods,and tools for the development and maintainence of high quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages like FORTAN and C
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The arrial of structured programming in the 1970s and
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle consists of several phases:
-Requirements which is the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements
-Design is the creation of  high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
-Implementation is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
-Testingis conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment is releasing the software to users or customers.
-Maintenance is providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall and the Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. The Waterfall approach favours structure(step by step),thorough planning and execution while the Agile approach is favours feedback and adaptation ( you build and review until you get to the finished product).  The waterfall methodology would be used in a construction project like a building where each step would have to be completed before the next step. The agile methodology would be used for an application where you would need to have a prototype and versions of the app until it is perfected.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are important in the software developmemnt process as tools that streamline the development process by providing comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) and tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion) respectively.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The common challenges faced by software engineers are changing requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debt. The strategies for overcoming these challenges are using agile methodologies, task prioritisation, good communication.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
They are important because they ensure that that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting questions and statements in a clear and concise way to get the best possible answer from AI models and its important as we interact with AI modes because they need to understand what you are asking specifically

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt would be "Where is the best holiday destination?" and the prompt version would be "Where is the best holiday destination in South Africa within a 100km radius from my current location?". The improved prompt is more effective because it doesn't generate general answers but information you could realisitically use.
